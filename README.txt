Velan Portfolio — Final (video-matched animations)

How to run:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. Open http://localhost:5173

What I tuned:
- Typing effect on tagline (Typewriter component)
- Precise Framer Motion delays, durations, and easing to match video-style timing
- Floating animation on profile image
- Staggered skill badges and project in-view triggers
- Hover glow on CTA button
- PostCSS configured for Tailwind v4 via @tailwindcss/postcss

Notes:
- Replace project screenshot at public/projects/naturecart-placeholder.png with a real capture for best fidelity.
- Profile image at src/assets/profile.jpg (already copied from your upload if present).
- Resume at public/resume.pdf (copied if present).
